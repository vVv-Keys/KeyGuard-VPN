# KEYSPERSONALVPNFRAMEWORK 

## for all my nooby friends, people aspiring in science, maybe you just like RUST and are bored like me so you maeke things with it just because you knwo you can. Whatever it may be - here we gO!



# CURRENT FEATURES:
```
1. TCP Server: The Rust program sets up a TCP server that listens for incoming connections on 127.0.0.1:8080.

2. Handling Client Connections: When a client connects to the server, a new thread is spawned to handle the client connection.

3. Encryption: The server uses AES-256 encryption in CBC mode for securing the communication. It initializes encrypter and decrypter instances with a randomly generated secret key.

4. Data Encryption and Decryption: Incoming data from the client is encrypted using the initialized encrypter, and then sent back to the client. Similarly, data received from the client is decrypted using the decrypter.

5.  Multithreading: The server handles multiple client connections concurrently by spawning a new thread for each incoming connection. This allows the server to serve multiple clients simultaneously.

6 .Random Secret Key Generation: A random 256-bit secret key is generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator (RNG). This key is used for encryption and decryption of data.
```

# UPCOMIGN FEATURES/PAID FEATURRES:

### not available at this time. You can have the basic encryprted framework for free and learn how to set up VPN to use for yourself to save yourself a momnthly subscription etc et c on me alreadyh. It is up to you to figure out how to take said framework and make it better - if you can't well - hey keep trying :D is a fun world and a good problem to sovlve!
